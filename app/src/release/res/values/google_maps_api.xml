    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=97:1E:EC:33:13:99:75:BD:44:D1:BC:FC:2D:1F:5F:9F:DB:BF:EB:7C%3Bcom.joaquimley.birdsseyeview

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    97:1E:EC:33:13:99:75:BD:44:D1:BC:FC:2D:1F:5F:9F:DB:BF:EB:7C;com.joaquimley.birdsseyeview

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
